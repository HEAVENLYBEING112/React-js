Armstrong number == narcistic number == power sum

REACT: 
   react is an (SPA ==> Single Page Application)
   virtual DOM ==> updates only the  particular section upon render (only header or para or list)
   real DOM ==> updates entire code on render(entire code)
   in react we can reuse a component(we can use a some code and use it on multiple areas just by calling)

   ..  ==> one folder before

   ./  ==> current directory

   js  ==> java script (only code in java)

   jsx  ==> in this java script we can code in html (jsx == jsxml);

   <> </>  ==> (empty tags) otherwise (fragments) ==> to return multiple lines we need to use fragment

   <Info/>  ==> slash at the end is used to call the file

   import React from 'react';  ==> must include headerfile

   export default (function name)  ==> export a function
   ex:
   export default Projectfile

   import Projectfile from './Projectfile'  ==> import the exported file in another file

   if it is mentioned as ./ it refers that the importing file location is same as the current file as both are in same folder

   if not it will be as './src/Projectfile'  ==> to import from other folder

   closures ==> we send the variable globally and store value in it

   arr =[1,2,3[4,5,6]]	==> the output should be 5 so ==> arr[3][1]  ==> 3 denotes the position of second array and 1 denotes value in the second array

   map create a new array from existing arroy

   map does not affect the original array
